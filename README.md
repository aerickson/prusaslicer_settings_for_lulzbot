# prusaslicer_settings_for_lulzbot

similar to https://github.com/sn4k3/Ender3, but for Lulzbots

## current status

This is working for me on my Lulzbot Mini v1. I use it instead of Cura currently.

I do have a different wiper installed on my Mini
(https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1976831), so the note that if you're looking
to use this.

## directions

To install the bed model, follow steps at https://github.com/sn4k3/Ender3.
